# Introduction
This is a simple example for numpy native extension. It takes in a numpy array, multiples each element by a number, and returns the result as a new numpy array.

This is to give everybody a starting point to work on because I could not find a complete example for python 3.

It has been tested on my Win7 local machine and on pythonanywhere.com which is assumed to run Ubuntu.

# Working environment:
* python 3.6
* numpy 1.13.1

# To install:
python setup.py install

# To run test:
python test.py
